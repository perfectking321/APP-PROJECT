## 3. GUI Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Design Pattern Used

The application implements the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

**Model (Backend):**
- `Room.java` - Represents room specifications (dimensions, budget)
- `Furniture.java` - Represents furniture catalog items
- `RoomLayout.java` - Represents the generated layout result
- `FurniturePosition.java` - Represents furniture placement coordinates

**View (Frontend - React Components):**
- `App.jsx` - Main application container and state orchestrator
- `RoomForm.jsx` - User input form for room specifications
- `LayoutDisplay.jsx` - Visual display of generated layout
- `FurnitureItem.jsx` - Individual furniture representation on floor plan
- `CostSummary.jsx` - Budget and cost breakdown display
- `LoadingSpinner.jsx` - Loading state indicator

**Controller (Backend):**
- `LayoutRestController.java` - REST API endpoints handler
- `LayoutService.java` - Business logic for layout generation
- `AIService.java` - AI API integration service
- `RuleEngine.java` - Layout validation and rules enforcement

This separation ensures maintainability, scalability, and clear responsibility boundaries between components.

### 3.2 GUI Framework/Technology

**Frontend Stack:**
- **React 18.2.0:** Component-based JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces with efficient rendering through Virtual DOM
- **Vite 5.0.8:** Modern build tool providing fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.0:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with responsive design

**Backend Stack:**
- **Spring Boot 3.2.2:** Comprehensive framework for building production-ready REST APIs with embedded server
- **Java 17:** Modern, long-term support version of Java with enhanced features

**Rationale:** React was chosen for its component reusability and large ecosystem. Vite provides significantly faster development experience compared to traditional bundlers. Spring Boot offers enterprise-grade backend capabilities with minimal configuration.

## 5. Feature Implementation

### 5.1 Core Functionality

The application follows a linear workflow from input to output:

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Room Input:**
   - User enters room length (meters)
   - User enters room width (meters)
   - User specifies budget constraint (USD)

2. **Generate Layout:**
   - Form validation ensures all inputs are within acceptable ranges
   - Data sent to backend via POST request to `/api/layout`
   - Backend processes room specifications
   - AI service generates optimal furniture arrangement
   - Furniture items retrieved from database
   - Layout coordinates calculated based on room dimensions

3. **Display Results:**
   - Frontend receives layout data with furniture positions
   - 2D floor plan rendered with accurate scaling
   - Furniture items positioned at specified coordinates
   - Furniture list displayed with details

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Total cost computed from selected furniture prices
   - Budget comparison performed
   - Cost summary displayed with breakdown
   - Visual indicators show budget status

### 5.2 User Interactions and Events

The application responds to various user interactions through event handlers:

| Event | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **onChange** | User types in input field | Updates form state, validates if field was previously touched |
| **onBlur** | User leaves input field | Marks field as touched, performs validation, shows errors if any |
| **onSubmit** | User clicks "Generate Layout" button | Validates all fields, prevents submission if errors exist, calls API |
| **onClick (Reset)** | User clicks "Design Another Room" | Clears all state, returns to initial form view |
| **onMouseEnter** | User hovers over furniture item | Displays tooltip with furniture details |
| **onMouseLeave** | User moves cursor away from furniture | Hides tooltip |

### 5.3 Data Validation and Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity:

**Validation Rules:**

| Field | Validation Rules |
|-------|-----------------|

## 6. Code Structure and Implementation

### 6.1 Main GUI Files Structure

The frontend codebase is organized following React best practices:

```
src/
├── main.jsx                    # Application entry point, renders App component
├── App.jsx                     # Root component, manages global state and routing
├── index.css                   # Global styles and Tailwind CSS imports
│
├── components/
│   ├── RoomForm.jsx           # Input form for room specifications
│   ├── LayoutDisplay.jsx      # Layout visualization component
│   ├── FurnitureItem.jsx      # Individual furniture renderer on floor plan
│   ├── CostSummary.jsx        # Budget and cost breakdown display
│   └── LoadingSpinner.jsx     # Loading state indicator
│
├── services/
│   └── api.js                 # Axios configuration and API methods
│
└── utils/
    ├── constants.js           # Application constants (validation rules, API URLs)
    └── mockData.js            # Mock data for development/testing
```

**File Purposes:**
- **Components:** Reusable UI building blocks with specific responsibilities
- **Services:** API communication layer abstracting HTTP requests
- **Utils:** Shared constants and helper functions

### 6.2 Key Functions and Methods

The following are the most critical functions in the application:

**1. handleFormSubmit (App.jsx)**
```javascript
const handleFormSubmit = async (formData) => {
  // Sets loading state, calls API, handles success/error
}
```
Purpose: Orchestrates the layout generation process by coordinating state updates and API calls.

**2. generateLayout (api.js)**
```javascript
generateLayout: async (roomData) => {
  // POST request to backend with room specifications
}
```
Purpose: Sends room data to backend and returns layout result.

**3. renderFurniture (LayoutDisplay.jsx)**
```javascript
furniture.map((item, index) => (
  <FurnitureItem key={index} furniture={item} scale={scale} />
))
```
Purpose: Iterates through furniture array and renders each item on the floor plan.

### 6.3 Event Handlers

Event handlers manage user interactions throughout the application:

| Handler | Location | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `handleChange` | RoomForm.jsx | Updates form field state on input change |
| `handleBlur` | RoomForm.jsx | Validates field when user leaves input |
| `handleSubmit` | RoomForm.jsx | Validates all fields and triggers form submission |
| `handleReset` | App.jsx | Clears state and returns to initial view |
| `handleMouseEnter` | FurnitureItem.jsx | Shows tooltip on furniture hover |
| `handleMouseLeave` | FurnitureItem.jsx | Hides tooltip when hover ends |

### 6.4 State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks:

**Primary State Variables (App.jsx):**
- `roomData` - Stores submitted room specifications
- `layoutResult` - Stores API response with furniture layout
- `loading` - Boolean indicating API call in progress
- `error` - Stores error message if API call fails

**Form State Variables (RoomForm.jsx):**
- `formData` - Object containing length, width, budget values
- `errors` - Object storing validation error messages
- `touched` - Object tracking which fields have been interacted with

React's `useState` hook manages all state, and `useEffect` would be used for side effects (though not heavily utilized in this application).

### 6.5 Code Snippets (Important Sections)

**Snippet 1: Form Submission with Validation**
```javascript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Validate all fields
  const newErrors = {};
  Object.keys(formData).forEach((key) => {
    const error = validateField(key, formData[key]);
    if (error) newErrors[key] = error;
  });
  
  setErrors(newErrors);
  setTouched({ length: true, width: true, budget: true });
  
  // Submit only if no errors
  if (Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0) {
    onSubmit({
      length: parseFloat(formData.length),
      width: parseFloat(formData.width),
      budget: parseFloat(formData.budget),
    });
  }
};
```

**Snippet 2: API Call with Error Handling**
```javascript
const handleFormSubmit = async (formData) => {
  setLoading(true);
  setError(null);
  
  try {
    const result = await api.generateLayout(formData);
    setRoomData(formData);
    setLayoutResult(result);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err);
    console.error('Error generating layout:', err);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

**Snippet 3: Layout Rendering with Scaling**
```javascript
const scale = PIXELS_PER_METER;
const containerWidth = roomWidthM * scale;
const containerHeight = roomLengthM * scale;

return (
  <div style={{ width: `${containerWidth}px`, height: `${containerHeight}px` }}>
    {furniture.map((item, index) => (
      <FurnitureItem 
        key={index} 
        furniture={item} 
        scale={scale} 
      />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### 8.1 Summary

The development of the Interior Design Layout Planner presented several technical challenges that required innovative solutions and deep understanding of modern web development practices.

**Technical Challenges Overcome:**

1. **State Management Complexity:** 
   Managing multiple interdependent states (form data, validation errors, API responses, loading states) required careful planning to prevent inconsistent UI states and ensure smooth user experience.

2. **Responsive Scaling Algorithm:** 
   Implementing accurate floor plan scaling that adapts to different room sizes while maintaining proper furniture proportions demanded precise mathematical calculations and extensive testing across various screen sizes.

3. **Real-time Validation:** 
   Creating instant validation feedback without compromising user experience required implementing debouncing strategies and intelligent touch-state tracking to avoid overwhelming users with error messages.

4. **API Integration Error Handling:** 
   Developing robust error handling for network failures, timeouts, and server errors while providing meaningful feedback to users necessitated comprehensive exception handling strategies.

5. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** 
   Configuring proper CORS policies to enable secure communication between frontend and backend while preventing unauthorized access required understanding of web security principles.

6. **Performance Optimization:** 
   Ensuring smooth rendering of floor plans with multiple furniture items while maintaining 60fps required optimization techniques including React memoization and efficient DOM manipulation.

**Project Achievements:**

The project successfully demonstrates proficiency in:
- Modern React development with functional components and hooks
- RESTful API design and integration
- Responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS
- Client-side validation and error handling
